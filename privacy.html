Illustaâ€™s Commitment to User Privacy: Transparency in Data Collection
<br>
At Illusta, we understand the importance of user privacy and are committed to safeguarding your information. We want to be transparent about the data we collect and how we use it. 
<br>
Here's what we collect:

<b>Contact information:</b>When you reach out to us through the contact page, we ask for your name, email address, and phone number. This allows us to respond to your feedback and inquiries directly. 
<br>
<b>That's it!</b>
<br>
We don't track your browsing behavior, analyze cookies, or gather any other non-personal data while you navigate the website. Your privacy is our priority, and we believe you deserve control over your information.

<br>
<b>Why do we collect your contact details?</b>
<br>
We value feedback and believe in open communication. We ask for your name, email, and phone number to personalize our responses, understand your concerns better, and offer relevant solutions. By providing this information, you allow us to stay connected and address your needs effectively.
<br>
<b>Rest assured, we will never:</b>
<br>
* Sell or share your information with third parties for marketing or any other purpose without your explicit consent.
<br>
* Use your contact details for anything other than responding to your feedback or inquiries.
<br>
* Store your information longer than necessary. Once we address your concern, your data is securely deleted from our records.
<br>
At Illusta, we strive to build trust and transparency with our users. We believe that protecting your privacy is essential for maintaining a positive and secure online experience. We hope this explanation clarifies our data collection practices and assures you of our commitment to safeguarding your information.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're always happy to address your privacy queries.

<h1>Collecting your data with your consent  </h1>
</div>

<div class="tp2">
Our collection of your contact information in the form falls under the legal basis of **explicit consent**. By voluntarily filling in your details, you freely grant us permission to process them for the specific purpose outlined in the form (e.g., fulfilling your contract request and allowing us to replie to your feedback). Remember, you have complete autonomy over filling the form; providing your information is not mandatory and will not affect your access to any services or benefits but it is mandatory to fill the form completely to get in touch with us.  Your trust and control are paramount to us, and we strive to only collect data with your clear and informed consent.

 <div class="text3">
<h1>Data Sharing and Third Parties</h1>
</div>

<div class="tp3">
We understand the importance of protecting your data. At Illusta, your privacy is our top priority. Therefore, we **do not share any user data with anyone**, including third-party services, for any marketing or analytical purposes. This transparency is fundamental to our commitment to earning your trust.

The information you provide is used solely for the specific purpose outlined in the form you filled out. For example, contact details may be used to fulfill your contract request, but never sold or shared for additional purposes. We employ robust security measures to safeguard your data, restricting access only to authorized personnel directly involved in fulfilling your request.

Rest assured, when you choose Illusta, you choose control over your data. We value your privacy and ensure your information remains strictly confidential.

 <div class="text4">
<h1>Data deletion</h1>
</div>

<div class="tp4">
 Illusta takes your data privacy seriously and understands the importance of data minimization. That's why we implement a strict deletion policy: **all contact requests from users are automatically deleted after 30 days**. This means any information you provide when requesting a contract, including your contact details, is securely erased from our systems after one month.

This approach ensures your data is only retained for the minimum necessary time to fulfill your request. After 30 days, the information becomes obsolete and is promptly removed. This proactive deletion process minimizes the risk of data breaches and protects your privacy over the long term.

Should you need to renew your contract request after 30 days, simply submit a new form. This ensures fresh information is used while respecting your right to data deletion.

By implementing this transparent and secure deletion policy, Illusta demonstrates its commitment to your privacy and data control. You can trust that your information is used responsibly and deleted promptly within the predefined timeframe.
