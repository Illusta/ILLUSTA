<h1>The Idea</h1>
</div>

<div class="tp3">
Illusta was born from the genuine need for visually enriching educational resources. Conceived by a visionary 14-year-old student, Illusta's founder experienced the frustration of bland, uninspiring notes during their own learning journey. Fueled by a desire to transform this struggle into an opportunity, the young founder envisioned a platform where education seamlessly intertwined with captivating illustrations. Driven by personal experience and a passion for learning, Illusta emerged as a testament to the power of youth innovation, proving that even at 14, one can make a significant impact in the realm of education.
